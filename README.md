### Overview
This is a coding challenge that aims to separate the deterministic battle simulation packed into a separate simulation library from the Unreal Engine simulation viewer, which can be used to replay the battle outcome using the simulation library.

### Pre-Requisites
* Unreal Engine 5.4.4

### Known Issues
* Grid size value should be even due to the limitation of standard UE checkered grid rendering material usage
